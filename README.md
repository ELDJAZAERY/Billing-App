# React Native using Expo and Typescript

This is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) demo app using the [Expo framework](https://expo.io) and written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org).


## Prerequisites
- [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/).
- You don't need to install any global npm packages for this repo. `expo-cli` is included as a dev dependency.


## Running the App

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```


#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.
